* Start the stage, unmute to become speaker on it's own if it's a stage (as long as the bot is a stage moderator)

### Stage Presence as Activity!
* For stage channels started by the bot, people would have a custom activity as long as they keep hearing!

## Switch Streams!

* Supported streams: direct links
* Why direct-only? streaming from other sources such as soundcloud or youtube is not so safe on Discord, the stream links generated may also take a pause causing the bot to reboot more often
* You can play any direct stream, I use [ilovemusic.de](https://ilovemusic.de/streams/)

Lastly, you're free to use, share, and modify this project, as long as you give proper credits to the developer!
